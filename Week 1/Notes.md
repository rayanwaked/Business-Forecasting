# Week 1: Introduction to Predictive Process

## Introduction to Business Forecasting
- **Purpose**: Forecasting facilitates informed decision-making by providing insights into future trends.
- **Course Focus**: Quantitative forecasting techniques, specifically regression modeling, classification modeling, and time series forecasting.

## Quantitative vs. Qualitative Forecasting
- **Quantitative Forecasting**: Relies on hard data and numerical analysis.
- **Qualitative Forecasting**: Involves expert judgment and educated estimates.

## Techniques Covered
1. **Regression Modeling**:
    - Predicts outcomes based on variables like house features or car specifications.
2. **Classification Modeling**:
    - Predicts events like customer purchase likelihood or churn rate.
3. **Time Series Forecasting**:
    - Predicts future demand based on historical sales data.

## Week 1 Agenda
- **Prediction Accuracy vs. Interpretability**: Balancing accurate predictions with model interpretability.
- **Key Ingredients of Predictive Models**: Understanding problem context, gathering relevant data, and utilizing appropriate computational tools like R.

## Essential Predictive Modeling Terminologies
- **Data Point**: Represents a single unit of data (e.g., a customer, a house).
- **Sample**: Subset of data points or a group of data points.
- **Predictors (Independent Variables)**: Input variables used for prediction.
- **Outcome (Dependent Variable)**: Variable being predicted.
- **Continuous Data**: Numeric variables with natural scales.
- **Categorical Data**: Variables without numerical scales, often represented by text.
- **Training Set and Test Set**: Data subsets used for model development and evaluation, respectively.
- **Model Building and Training**: Process of determining model equations using data.

## Predictive Modeling Process
1. **Define Modeling Goals**: Understand the business problem and set modeling objectives.
2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather and preprocess relevant data.
3. **Data Splitting**: Divide data into training and test sets.
4. **Model Development**: Build predictive models using training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and compare different models.
6. **Model Selection and Implementation**: Choose the best-performing model for implementation.

## Predictive Applications
- **Retail, Healthcare, Finance, etc.**: Predictive modeling is applied across various industries.
- **Examples**: Predicting consumer behavior, detecting sickness in healthcare, forecasting product demand, etc.

## Conclusion
- **Next Steps**: Introduction to R and RStudio for predictive modeling.
