# Week 3: Overfitting and Model Tuning

## Introduction
- Welcome to Week 3!
- Focus: Overfitting, model tuning, data splitting, and resampling techniques.

## Overfitting
- **Definition**: Model error when closely fitted to training data but performs poorly on new data.
- **Goal**: Achieve appropriate-fitting models.
- **Comparison**: Under-fitting, appropriate-fitting, and over-fitting.

## Model Tuning
- **Process**: Adjusting model parameters to control overfitting.
- **Example**: KNN model tuning with the parameter "K".
- **Optimization**: Finding optimal parameter values through model utility assessment.

## Data Splitting
- **Purpose**: Splitting dataset into training and test sets.
- **Detection**: Helps identify potential overfitting issues.
- **Techniques**:
    1. Simple random sampling.
    2. Stratified random sampling.
    3. Maximum dissimilarity sampling.

## Simple Random Sampling
- **Definition**: Basic method without controlling data attributes.
- **Example**: Online course satisfaction survey.

## Stratified Random Sampling
- **Definition**: Random sampling within subgroups.
- **Example**: Surveying customer experience across different age groups.

## Practice
- Next, we'll practice data splitting techniques using the "supplierRank" Excel file.
