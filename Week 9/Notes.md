- Fitting ARIMA models and performing model residuals check using `checkresiduals()` R function.
- Practice in forecasting future series.

## Autocorrelation in Time Series Data
Autocorrelation refers to the correlation between neighboring values in a time series, indicating the linear relationship between values of a series in neighboring periods. It ranges from -1 to 1, with positive autocorrelation indicating a value between 0 and 1, and negative autocorrelation indicating a value between -1 and 0.

### Computing Autocorrelation
- Computed by correlating the series with a lagged version of itself.
- Lagged series data is the original series moved forward by one or more periods.
- `ggAcf()` function from the forecast package is used for computing and plotting autocorrelations at different lags.

## ARIMA Models
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, capturing autocorrelation beyond trend and seasonality to improve forecasts. It consists of three components: AR (AutoRegressive), I (Integrated), and MA (Moving Average), denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q).

### Components of ARIMA
- **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Models the dependent variable as a linear combination of its own past values. The order `p` determines the number of past observations included.
- **Integrated (I)**: Involves differencing the series data to achieve stationarity, removing trends and seasonality. The order `d` indicates the number of differencing rounds.
- **Moving Average (MA)**: Models the dependent variable as a linear combination of its past forecast errors. The order `q` determines the number of forecast errors included.

## Forecasting Process
1. Visualize the time series data and its autocorrelation.
2. Fit ARIMA models and perform a residuals check using `checkresiduals()`.
3. Use the model that passes the residuals check for forecasting future series.

### Residuals Check
It's crucial to check the autocorrelation of the residual series to ensure the fitted forecasting model has adequately captured all patterns and autocorrelation information.

## Conclusion
This session covered the importance of autocorrelation in time series forecasting, introduced ARIMA models, and outlined the process for fitting these models and forecasting. The next session will delve into two forms of ARIMA and detailed forecasting processes.

# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)

# Example time series data
# Note: Replace `your_time_series` with your actual time series variable
your_time_series <- ts(rnorm(100), frequency=12, start=c(2021,1))

# Visualize the time series data
plot(your_time_series, main="Time Series Data")

# Compute and plot autocorrelation
acf(your_time_series, main="Autocorrelation of Time Series")
ggAcf(your_time_series)

# Fit an ARIMA model
# Note: (p,d,q) should be determined based on ACF/PACF plots and/or automatic selection
# For demonstration, we're using auto.arima to automatically select the best (p,d,q)
fit_arima <- auto.arima(your_time_series)
summary(fit_arima)

# Check residuals
checkresiduals(fit_arima)

# Forecast future series
future_forecast <- forecast(fit_arima, h=12) # Forecast next 12 periods
plot(future_forecast, main="Forecasted Time Series")

# Summary
# The code provided walks through the essential steps for time series analysis and forecasting
# using ARIMA models in R. It starts with data visualization, autocorrelation analysis, model fitting,
# residuals checking, and concludes with forecasting future values of the series.
